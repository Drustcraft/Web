    <h3>13. Macros/Scripts</h3>
    <div class="track">( Kick -> 7d Ban -> Permanent Ban )</div>
    <p>
      Anything that loops commands or automatically performs tasks for you
      without having to do anything is prohibited. This includes external

    <h3>14. Exploiting/Abusing a plugin</h3>
    <div class="track">( Permanent Ban )</div>
    <p>
      Using a bug to for example duplicate gear/items, anything that would give
      you an unfair advantage, is considered exploiting. If you stumble upon
      something that you think is an exploit, contact an administrator so it can
      be fixed as soon as possible. The above punishment length tree is most
      likely to change depending on the severity of your offense. The severity
      of the bug determines the length of your ban. Typically we generously
      reward players who report game-breaking bugs.
    </p>

    <h3>15. Ban/Mute Evading</h3>
    <div class="track">( Permanent Ban )</div>
