    <h1>Bedrock/Tablet Change</h1>

    <h3>Change to Server Settings</h3>
    <p>
      Hi all, where have had to make a change to the settings that our Bedrock
      or Tablet players connect to our network.
    </p>
    <p>
      Previously, these awesome players used port <strong>19132</strong> to
      connect, this has now changed to <strong>20132</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's easy to change, simply open Minecraft and tap on
      <strong>Play</strong> button. Next tap on the <strong>Servers</strong> tab
      and go down to the <strong>Drustcraft</strong> server (or whatever you
      named it when you added it). Tap the Pencil, then change the field for the
      server port to <strong>20132</strong>. Tap <strong>Save</strong> and you
      are ready to play!
    </p>

    <p>Good Luck and see you in Azentina, --nomadjimbob</p>
