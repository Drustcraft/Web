Thank for for considering a contribution! Generally, Drustcraft welcomes PRs from everyone. There are some guidelines about what features should go where:


*Pull requests that may not get accepted:* Niche features that apply to a specific group, for example an item that would not be widely used by other players or developers. For now, please create a separate Denizen script if possible. 


We have a rundown of all you need to know to develop over on our [wiki](https://github.com/Drustcraft/Web/wiki/Developer-Guide). If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to our [Discord](https://discord.drustcraft.com.au)!
